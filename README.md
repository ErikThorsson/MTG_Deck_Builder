**So what does it do?**

I find it handy for keeping track of my decks and tweaking them, experimenting with deck ideas, keeping track of my collection, and seeing what I don't have in a set. It has a comprehensive query system and a search bar for looking by name, tribal, keyword.

**Notable features:**
- Deck Notes
- Random card draw (in full version)
- Deck value and collection value is tracked.
- But my favorite is that it outputs your deck into the raw text format for tappedout.com so you can share decks fairly easily with your friends / whomever.

**Take Note:**

- Card prices are old and not currently connected via the web.
- Demo only contains about 200 cards. So only a few starting with A.
- Querying through all cards is a little slow right now and something I will optimize so stick to "my cards" for best results.
- While functional, swing doesn't exactly look too great on windows.
- Also for unknown reasons some cards may be french.
