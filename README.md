**So what does it do?**

I find it handy for keeping track of my decks and tweaking them, experimenting with deck ideas, keeping track of my collection, and seeing what I don't have in a set. It has a comprehensive query system and a search bar for looking by name, tribal, keyword.

**Notable features:**
- Deck Notes
- Random card draw (in full version)
- Deck value and collection value is tracked.
- But my favorite is that it outputs your deck into the raw text format for tappedout.com so you can share decks fairly easily with your friends / whomever.

**Take Note:**

- Card prices are old and not currently connected via the web.
- Demo only contains about 200 cards. So only a few starting with A.
- Querying through all cards is a little slow right now and something I will optimize so stick to "my cards" for best results.
- While functional, swing doesn't exactly look too great on windows.
- Also for unknown reasons some cards may be french.

- Unpack and move the VCO folder to your home directory (C:\Users\yourName).
- Click on the jar (You can move this to your desktop).

- Same as above but if on desktop, the folder will automatically move to your home folder when you first click the jar.

**Hotkeys:** (Check "deck build mode" or "sideboard" to add cards to respective tables.)

- Enter = add card
- \ = remove card
- ] = card to sideboard
- [ = sideboard to deck
